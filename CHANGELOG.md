# Changelog

## [1.61.0](https://github.com/dvorka/mytral/compare/v1.60.0...HEAD)

This MyTraL **minor** release brings:

### Added
- .

### Changed
- The activity feed now shows an equal three-way split (photo, map, elevation chart)
  for endurance activities that have both a highlight photo and a GPS route, instead
  of a two-way photo/map split.
- Replaced the animated gradient route polyline in the activity feed's map-only
  preview with a static grade histogram (distance share of steep descent, descent,
  flat, climb and steep climb), labelled under each bar.

### Fixed
- Fixed the gear chart view (`Settings > Gear > Chart`) showing the gear table
  underneath the chart instead of the chart alone.
- Fixed the gear component sidebar (`Settings > Gear > Edit`/`Detail`) always
  jumping back to the first component after adding, editing, servicing,
  retiring or un-retiring a component - it now stays on the component just
  changed.

### Documentation

## [1.60.0](https://github.com/dvorka/mytral/compare/v1.59.0...v1.60.0)

This MyTraL **minor** release brings:

### Added
- Added a Polar Flow integration: sync new training from Polar Flow via the
  official Polar AccessLink API and backfill full history from the Polar
  "Download your data" (GDPR) export ZIP. The export import brings in complete
  per-second recordings.
- Added filtering and sorting to the gear listing. Gear can be filtered by its default
  activity type and sorted by last used, name, default activity type, purchase date,
  usage, distance, time or TCoO in ascending or descending order. The summary cards
  reflect the filtered gear and the selection is preserved when switching between the
  list and the chart view.
- Added schema headers to `winget` manifests.
- Added document attachments to gear: manuals, invoices, warranty cards and
  other files.
- Added histogram of usages to gear detail.
- Added list of activities for given exercise, exercise label and delete button
  to exercise detail.
- Added strikethroung extension to the rendered Markdown texts.

### Changed
- The gear component `Cost` mini-card now shows the component total cost of ownership -
  the base cost plus the cost of all its service history entries - together with the
  cost per kilometer. A tooltip shows the base cost and the number of services.
- Polar Precision Performance import now reuses the heart-rate time series parsed by
  the import plugin when building recordings, instead of reading and parsing every
  `.hrm` file a second time in the worker process.
- The bookmarks list now hides the exercises/laps, source and workout columns, and
  the reorder buttons no longer wrap on narrow screens.
- Cancelled mytral.fitness domain & hosting:
    - web moved to my https://projects.mindforger.com/mytral
    - Flatpak qualified name changed from `fitness.mytral.Mytral` to `com.mindforger.Mytral`
- Moved GitHub repository from `dvorka-oss` organization back to the personal `dvorka`
  profile.

### Fixed
- Fixed the Polar Precision Performance (PPP) import end to end - importing a Polar
  data directory now finishes successfully instead of failing once an already existing
  activity had to be updated.
- Fixed the Polar PPP import silently dropping exercises it could not parse - such
  files are now counted and reported in the import task log.
- Fixed the average speed of imported Polar activities being recomputed - and the
  cap to maximum speed lost - after the activities were persisted.
- Fixed Polar PPP import log messages showing the raw `{self._log_name}` placeholder
  instead of the plugin name.
- Removed unused Polar gear service constants.
- Fixed Strava gear from an activity synchronization not being linked to the matching
  MyTraL gear when several items share the same brand - the gear is now resolved to the
  best-matching entry and its Strava gear ID is registered, instead of being left as an
  unresolved `strava-gear-id:...` placeholder. Each gear also gained an Advanced page
  showing its external service (Strava / Garmin / Polar) gear-ID mapping for debugging.
- Fixed the exercise photo gallery - it now appears on the exercise view page, where it
  can be viewed, uploaded to, edited and deleted, instead of being stuck on the edit page.
- Fixed exercises photos insert (from link to image).
- Fixed sport variety field at the end of the dashboard and added tooltips to all fields
  on that row.
- Fixed broken goal update which was failing.
- Fixed the style of links in the rendered markdown (newly underscore in blue).
- Fixed usage (hours/km) gear component calculation - newly the usage is from the
  installation date until now or replaced.

### Documentation
- Added functional architecture diagram to WWW.
- Fixed documentation by replacing non-ASCII characters with ASCII characters.
- Added motivation paragraph to `README.md` and WWW index.



## [1.59.0](https://github.com/dvorka/mytral/compare/v1.58.0...v1.59.0)

This MyTraL **minor** release brings:

### Added
- Added sport-aware Everesting experience on the dashboard. A new Everesting card tracks
  how much of Mt. Everest you have accumulated for your top climbing sport, with a
  Day/Week/Month/Year toggle.
  Climbing a full Everest - or a Quarter, Half, Double, or Triple - in a single activity
  earns an Everesting achievement badge shown on the activity, in activity lists, and on
  the "Highest Climb Ever" card.
- Added weekly elevation gain to the calendar year view. The last column of the calendar
  table now shows the total elevation climbed each week above the weekly weight.
- Added lifetime elevation gain to the Lifetime Totals insight.
- Added a new Histograms page - reachable from the Charts page - showing the
  distribution of your activities by distance, time, and elevation gain.
- Added Winget distribution Makefile targets, artifacts and scripts.

### Changed
- Replaced the "Years Active" dashboard summary card with a "Total Elevation" card
  showing the cumulative elevation gained across all activities.
- Everesting elevation is now counted per climbing sport (Ride, Run, Hike, and Nordic
  Ski) instead of lumping all sports together.

### Fixed
- Fixed the `This vs. Last` page showing the literal text "None" instead of a
  chart when the selected sport and period had no data - it now shows a friendly
  empty state.
- Fixed typos in GH issues in `README.md`.
- Removed dead code from around the code base (import).

### Documentation
- **WAITING FOR MYTRAL APPROVAL - THIS WILL WORK AS SOON AS MYTRAL IS IN**:
   - Documented Winget release process as a feature analysis in `docs/`.
   - Documented installing MyTraL on Windows via Winget in `INSTALLATION.md`.
- Listed the `Windows (winget)` installation method in README.md.
- Added new features screenshots for everesting and histograms.

### Web
- Improved WWW pages SEO by adding the sitemap, OG image, 404 page, and favicon.



## [1.58.0](https://github.com/dvorka/mytral/compare/v1.57.0...v1.58.0)

This MyTraL **minor** release brings:

### Added
- Improved the first login experience in MyTraL DESKTOP incarnation: when no
  user profile exists yet, a default `athlete` user ("MyTraL Athlete") is
  auto-created and auto-logged in, landing straight on the dashboard - no
  sign-up/login step required. Logging out disables auto-login until the next
  explicit login, so a second/third user can be added or logged into from the
  login page.
- Calendar and sickness heatmaps now mark today with a yellow rectangle so the
  current week and day stand out, and each sickness day's tooltip now reads like
  `2026-05-25: 3x sick` instead of a bare count.
- Added estimated speed to the analysis chart of the activity in case that activity
  recordings (as well as parquet) don't have it.
- Added tooltip with the elevation, time, distance and grade to the elevation chart
  on the activity analysis page.
- Added a macOS `.dmg` desktop distribution, built with PyInstaller and
  `hdiutil`/`iconutil` and attached to the `Distro macOS DMG` GitHub Actions workflow
  run for every release PR. The build targets Apple Silicon (arm64) only and ships
  unsigned (no Apple Developer certificate).
  See `docs/INSTALLATION.md` for the one-time Gatekeeper workaround needed
  on first launch.
  Data is stored in `~/Library/Application Support/mytral/` like every other macOS app.

### Fixed
- Fixed path(s) in Snap which pointed outside of strict confinement filesystem.

### Documentation
- Documented macOS Apple Silicon (arm64) installation and build.



## [1.57.0](https://github.com/dvorka/mytral/compare/v1.56.0...v1.57.0)

This MyTraL **minor** release brings:

### Added
- Published MyTraL to the Snap Store at https://snapcraft.io using **strict**
  confinement. The Snap Store snap runs the local server and opens the UI in the
  default browser. Athlete data are stored in `$SNAP_USER_COMMON`
  (`~/snap/mytral/common`) i.e. are NOT stored in the location used by all other
  distros - data persist until uninstall (snapd keeps a snapshot for ~31 days
  after `snap remove`).
- Added new body mannequin - from robot-like to realistic anatomical muscle
  geometry adapted from the MIT-licensed `react-native-body-highlighter`.
- Added activity bookmarks - bookmark any activity from its detail page.
- Added an `Elevation` aspect to the `This vs. Last` and `Charts` pages,
  comparing weekly, monthly, and yearly elevation gain. The weekly and monthly
  charts also show a dashed red `Everesting` (8848 m) reference line so athletes
  can see whether their cumulative climbing reaches Mt. Everest peak.

### Changed
- Redrew the body mannequin with realistic anatomical muscle geometry, used
  everywhere it appears (muscle load, injuries, and sickness). Muscle load now
  renders as a cool-to-hot volume heatmap.

### Documentation
- Documented both strict and classic Snap installations.
- Documented the missing `python3-all` build prerequisite for local `.deb` builds
  (`make distro-ubuntu-deb`) in the installation guide.

### Fixed
- Fixed Ubuntu PPA/`.deb` installation on Ubuntu releases that do not ship
  Python 3.12 as the system interpreter (`trusty` through `focal`) - `postinst`
  now uses `uv` to provision a self-contained Python 3.12 under `/opt/mytral`,
  independent of the host's system Python.
- Fixed `.deb` package `Architecture` metadata (`all` -> `amd64 arm64`) to match
  what `postinst`'s `uv` bootstrap actually supports, so `apt` refuses
  unsupported architectures upfront instead of installing a package that fails
  during configure.
- Fixed `.deb` `postinst` failing with an unclear `uv pip install` error when
  the bundled wheel or `requirements.txt` was missing - it now fails fast with a
  clear message.

### Security
- Hardened `.deb` `postinst`: the downloaded `uv` binary is now verified against
  a pinned `sha256` checksum before extraction, closing a supply-chain gap where
  a tampered or corrupted release asset would otherwise be executed as root
  during package installation.

### Infrastructure
- Rewrote `build/ubuntu/launchpad-release.sh` to accept an optional Ubuntu
  codename argument, building (and optionally uploading) a single distribution
  instead of always looping over every supported version.
- Added a `UBUNTU_VERSION` parameter (default `noble`) to `make
  distro-ubuntu-deb`, and a new `make distro-launchpad-release-version` target
  to build and upload a single Ubuntu version's PPA package.



## [1.56.0](https://github.com/dvorka/mytral/compare/v1.55.0...v1.56.0)

This MyTraL **minor** release brings:

### Added
- Added a Flatpak distribution (`fitness.mytral.Mytral`). The package runs the local
  server and opens the UI in the default browser.
  Athlete data are stored outside of the sandbox in the standard MyTraL directory.
- Added `Distro Tarball` GHA workflow that builds the upstream tarball in
  `rel/<major.minor.patch>` branches targeting `main`.
- Added `Distro Snap` GHA workflow that builds the Snap package in
  `rel/<major.minor.patch>` branches targeting `main`.
- Added `Distro Windows` GHA workflow that builds the Windows installer and ZIP archive
  on a Windows runner in `rel/<major.minor.patch>` branches targeting `main`.
- Added `Distro Flatpak` GHA workflow that builds the Flatpak bundle in
  `rel/<major.minor.patch>` branches targeting `main`.
- Added `distro-win-zip` Makefile target that packages the Windows desktop executable
  into a ZIP archive (`distro/windows/mytral-<version>.exe.zip`).

### Changed
- Removed the Waitress WSGI server from the desktop edition. The desktop app serves
  a single local, so it now uses Flask's built-in threaded server - this removes
  a dependency and simplifies installation and packaging across Snap, PPA,
  and the Windows installer.
- Updated `bleach` from 6.3 to 6.4.
- Updated `cryptography` from 46.0 to 48.0.
- Updated `msgpack` from 1.0 to 1.2.
- Updated `pytest` (dev) from 8.4 to 9.0.

### Documentation
- Documented Flatpak install and build.
- Documented Snap build.

### Fixed
- Fixed `distro-win-installer` Makefile target which depended on the Linux targets.



## [1.55.0](https://github.com/dvorka/mytral/compare/v1.54.0...v1.55.0)

This MyTraL **minor** release brings:

### Changed
- Switched from Python 3.11 to Python 3.12. The main reason is that Snap 22 runtime
  had Python 3.10 and Snap 24 runtime has Python 3.12. New Python constructs - like
  `type`, `override`, and `T` - will be incorporated as I go.

### Added
- Added improved Windows installer make targets and build artifacts.
- Added Ubuntu `resolute` to Launchpad PPA.

### Fixed
- Fixed "missing waitress" server in the MyTraL installation from PPA `apt` log.

### Documentation
- Banner improved by the switch to MyTraL WWW palette.



## [1.54.0](https://github.com/dvorka/mytral/compare/v1.53.0...v1.54.0)

This MyTraL **minor** release brings:

### Fixed
- Fixed and refactored Snap distribution builder to have `snapcraft.io` on repository
  paths required by snapcraft.io, use host's vs. container's resources correctly,
  and avoid use of (host) hard-coded paths.



## [1.53.0](https://github.com/dvorka/mytral/compare/v1.52.0...v1.53.0)

This MyTraL **minor** release brings:

### Added
- Added Windows installer built with Inno Setup 6
  (`build/windows/installer/mytral-setup.iss`). Installs to `C:\Program Files\MyTraL\`,
  registers an uninstaller, and optionally creates a Desktop shortcut.
- Added `distro-windows-installer` Makefile target to build the Windows installer after
  the desktop executable is built with `distro-desktop-build-win`.
- Added `distro-windows-clean` Makefile target to remove Windows installer build
  artifacts.
- Added Ubuntu PPA distribution for Ubuntu via Launchpad (`ppa:ultradvorka/sport`).
- Added `distro-ubuntu-deb` Makefile target to build `.deb` package locally.
- Added Snap package distribution for universal Linux package management. Opens a native
  desktop window via FlaskUI via classic confinement. User data stored in default
  locations.

### Fixed
- Fixed elevation chart rendering in the application's analysis page by smoothing
  the GPX points.
- Fixed `.deb` packaging: Python dependencies are installed into an isolated virtualenv at
  `/opt/mytral/venv/` - system Python environment is never polluted.
- Fixed `.deb` wrapper scripts to export `MYTRAL_INCARNATION`, `MYTRAL_USER_REGISTRATION`,
  and `MYTRAL_ENABLE_CACHE` environment variables for correct desktop startup.

### Performance
- Fixed top calendar week navigation which was slooow as it was build on the frontend -
  moved it to the backend.
- Fixed top feed day navigation which was slooow as it was build on the frontend -
  moved it to the backend.
- Fixed duplicated activities list loading by the `routes.py::calendar_view()`

## Documentation
- Added MyTraL configuration guide.
- Added Ubuntu PPA installation guide.
- Added Ubuntu .deb installation guide.



## [1.52.0](https://github.com/dvorka/mytral/compare/v1.51.0...v1.52.0)

This MyTraL **minor** release brings:

### Added

- Added Python @ Ubuntu distribution guide.
- Added Debian @ Docker distribution guide.
- Added Fedora @ Docker distribution guide.



## [1.51.0](https://github.com/dvorka/mytral/compare/v1.50.0...v1.51.0)

This MyTraL **minor** release brings:

### Added
- Added activity type color border hint to goals, gear, and several other pages.

- Added card encouraging athlete to create an activity to pages which need at least one
  activity to render.
- Added weight to gear.
- Added tarball distribution.
- Added Debian @ Docker distribution.
- Added Fedora @ Docker distribution.
- Added weight field to gear model allowing track the weight of your gear like running
  shoes, or bikes.

### Fixed

- Fixed exercise / symptom delete message to contain display name (not UUID) when
  removing these entities from an activity.
- Removed color from Strava links on the day activities view and search result view.
- Fixed exercise and symptom delete pages to show display names instead of UUIDs.

## Documentation
- Adding the installation documentation.



## [1.50.0](https://github.com/dvorka/mytral/compare/v1.9.0...v1.50.0)

This MyTraL release is very **special** to me. After years of coding and hacking
together various versions of MyTraL I am moving to a brand-new Git repository on my 50th
birthday.

Sports have been my main hobby for 40 years - I have 30 years of training data scattered
across everything from paper logs to MyTraL. Today, I’m starting a fresh chapter - free
from hacks, sensitive data and the "sins of my youth."

Channeling Steve Prefontaine energy today - pure heart, max effort, FLOSS execution!

### Added
- Added polyline with map background to the activity feed.
- Added rainbow polyline w/ running dot to the activity feed.
- Added elevation chart to the activity feed.
- Added "maximize map" action to the activity view page.
- Added description field to symptoms so that user can specify how to cure such injury
  or illness.
- Added import of Strava bulk user export ZIP archive (activities, GPX/TCX recordings,
  photos).
- Added TCX import (individual files and directory of recordings/archives).
- Added `gender` field to the athlete profile in order to calculate metrics like TRIMP
  more accurately.
- Added TRIMP calculation and chart to the `Progress` menu.
- Added FIT directory import - import all FIT files from a local directory in one go,
  with automatic conflict detection and parquet generation.
- Bulldozer framework - a multiprocessing-based sandboxed job runner for
  parallelizing CPU-bound import workloads across multiple cores.
- GPX polyline encoding with 2 selectable methods: fast distance-based sampling
  (default) and legacy RDP-based simplification for preview rendering. New GPX polyline
  encoding is ~4000× faster with the new distance-based sampling method - the default
  for all recording import paths.
- Added meta sport taxonomy based lifetime totals insight page.
- Added new cards on the homepage indicating the risk of injury, gear needed service,
  suggested activity and weight balance.
- Added resting HR estimate to the athlete metrics page.

### Changed
- Strava API import is not hidden behing feature flag (just inverse condition on FE).
- Refactored Predictions insight page to two pages - Predictions and Analytics.
- Rewritten task manager, tasks and tasks invocation - removed duplicated task manager
  definitions, converged to MyTraL's task manager, typed tasks are used from now on.
- Strava bulk ZIP archive import rewritten with Bulldozer framework for parallel
  photo & recording upload, parquet conversion, and GPX map-data precomputation.
- Polar Precision Performance import rewritten with Bulldozer framework - HRM blob
  upload and parquet generation now run in .

### Removed
- Removed `Suffer Score` from the ActivityEntity and related forms and HTML code.

### Fixed
- Fixed blobstore logging message which no longer specifies wrong blob type.
- Polar HRM import conflict resolution no longer fails on missing year-cache entries.
- `fit_tool` monkeypatch tolerates non-UTF8 bytes in FIT string fields (Garmin
  developer fields), preventing silent parse failures.
- Fixed many problems in the Polar PPP import - from user forgetting to switch
  the activity type, to the source of data (HRM vs. PDD) and the right units.
- Fixed notifications decorator - it's newly tightly coupled w/ the icon.



## [1.9.0](https://github.com/dvorka/my-training-log/compare/v1.8.0...v1.9.0)

This MyTraL **minor** release brings:

### Added
- Added import from FIT.
- Added import from GPX - file or directory.
- Added GPX recording management: upload, view metadata, edit name/description/keywords,
  download, and delete.
- Added storing of recorded data (FIT, GPX, Polar HRM) to Parquet and Polars-based
  loading/saving.
- Added power zones.
- Added HR zones.
- Added 2D maps rendering for GPX recordings.
- Added athlete performance metrics w/ FTP, aerobic/anaerobic thresholds, ... estimates.
- Added recorded data analytics - ridge/bar/line charts of various metrics.
- Added multi-photo upload support for activities - up to 50 photos per activity.
- Added outfits selection to activity create and update (all) forms.
- Added outfits display to activity detail page.
- Added sickness / injury in time chart.
- Added day-based navigation to the activity feed.
- Added week-based navigation to the caledar activity view.
- Added avatar/photo upload support for users, AI coaches, gear, goals, and exercises.
- Added preview of TabPFN ML-powered predictions feature with dedicated settings and
  predictions pages (behind feature flag).
- Added sponsor link to the application layout.
- Added Windows binary build.
- Added and expanded sport taxonomy and mappings (new meta_activity_type, many new AT_*
  constants, Strava/FIT mappings, Concept2 uses AT_ROW_ERG).
- Enriched bootstraps for activity types, exercises, and symptoms (muscle groups,
  descriptions/default weights, symptom body-part targeting) with new pytest coverage.

### Changed
- Core data model changes:
  - `ActivityEntity.sport` renamed to `ActivityEntity.activity_type_key` - breaks
    backward compatibility.
  - Added `ActivityEntity.avg_cadence` and `ActivityEntity.max_cadence` - consider
    rides, rowing, swimming, and other activities.
  - Added `ActivityEntity.meta_activity_type` - consider `ski` aggregating DP/F roller
    ski, DP/F nordic ski, ...
  - Added `ActivityEntity.tags`.
  - Added `ActivityEntity.is_plan`.
- Reworked photo UI flows (entity photo galleries, activity/exercise photo metadata
  editor pages, markdown image support) and updated documentation site pages.
- Data migration framework:
  - Migration step: rename sport to activity type in activities and gears.
  - Migration step: merge new activity types, exercises and symptoms.
  - Expert UI tool: migration of activities from one activity type to another.
  - Python tool: re-sync Strava activities to re-new lost source attributes.

### Fixed
- Activity update no longer purges source attributes (ID, descriptor and URL).
- Blobstore exception handling in activity view/update routes now only silently ignores
  expected `BlobStoreError`; unexpected errors are logged and re-raised for easier
  debugging.
- GPX import rewritten to be non-blocking (except upload) and to make intensive work in
  the asynchronous task.

### Performance
- Per-request total size limit is now enforced when uploading multiple photos in a
  single request, preventing excessive memory use.
- EXIF metadata stripping in image processing no longer materialises the full pixel
  array into a Python list; metadata is cleared in-place, reducing memory allocation
  significantly for large images.

### Documentation
- HTML documentation is newly generated from Markdown files in this repository.
- Public HTML documentation for mytral.fitness is newly generated from Markdown files in
  this repository.

### Tests
- Added random attack which generates synthetic data of all MyTraL entities including
  attachments and recordings.



## [1.8.0](https://github.com/dvorka/my-training-log/compare/v1.7.0...v1.8.0)

This MyTraL **minor** release brings:

### Added
- ACoaches - AI coaching feature powered by LLM providers:
  - Configure LLM providers: local Ollama, Anthropic Claude,
    or OpenAI GPT - each with optional API key stored encrypted at rest.
  - Define AI coaches with custom names and system prompts (personality, focus area,
    coaching style); built-in out-of-the-box prompt templates to get started quickly.
  - Persistent multi-turn chat sessions with each coach - full history saved per user.
  - Context-aware responses: coaches automatically receive recent activities, PRs,
    gear, symptoms, and athlete profile as structured context with every message.
  - Streaming responses for real-time token-by-token output in the chat UI.
  - Fetch available models directly from a running Ollama instance.
  - New dependencies: `anthropic`, `openai`, `pydantic-ai`, `griffe`.
- Extensibility API: introducing ability of pluggable activities importers.
- Desktop and webapp MyTraL incarnation which controls sign-up and log-in process.
- Users are newly allowed to enable auto-login on desktop.
- Dashboard revamp for better UX - advanced charts refactored to `Insights`,
  this vs. last month moved to the dashboard.
- Injection of feature flags to Jinja templates.
- Import of activities from Concept2 CSV, Google Sheets CSV, MyTraL JSON.
- Import of entities from MyTraL JSON files.
- Rewritten Strava API (developer) integration (deprecated due to legal term changes).

### Fixed
- Completely rewritten MyTraL configuration, ability to configure MyTraL using environment
  variables and default values.
- Fixed directory resolution and use to by compliant with XDG base directory specification
  https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/
- Removed `desktop.key` to ensure portability in case that MyTraL is used on different
  machines which share the data.
- Fixed discarded fields when updating activities - add/edit/delete
  exercises/lap/symptom while other fields were modified lead to the loss of data.
- Fixed desktop distribution build as it became the main distribution incarnation going
  forward.



## [1.7.0](https://github.com/dvorka/my-training-log/compare/v1.6.0...v1.7.0)

This MyTraL **minor** release brings:

### Added
- Ability to specify muscle groups for exercises and activity types - shown in
  the activity detail and day pages.
- Ability to specify body part for symptoms - shown in `Me` page.
- Muscle group heatmap in the day presented as manequinn.
- Previous / next day navigation in the day and activity view.
- Structured logging using `structlog`.
- User dataset size statistics to the account page.

### Performance
- Deployments and build configuration upgraded from Python 3.10 to Python 3.11.
- Source code migrated to 3.11 constructions like `match` or `Self`.

### Fixed
- Progress/PRs grouping based on time e.g. 30' laps.



## [1.6.0](https://github.com/dvorka/my-training-log/compare/v1.5.0...v1.6.0)

This MyTraL **minor** release brings:

### Added
- Filtering of fields in create / update activity HTML pages.
- Filtering of exercise types by tag.
- Markdown support for activity, exercise type, gear, outfit, goal, and lap/route descriptions.
- Ranked laps: added `ranked` boolean field to `LapEntity` so individual laps within
  an activity can be marked as personal bests, mirroring the existing `ranked` flag on
  activities.
- Progress / PRs page now includes ranked laps in addition to ranked activities, showing
  lap name, distance, duration, activity types, and date with a link back to the parent activity.

### Performance
- DRY of Jinja templates - new macros and includes.

### Security
* Moved Flask `SECRET_KEY` to `MYTRAL_SECRET_KEY` (with a random per-start fallback +
  warning) and restricted CORS origins via `MYTRAL_CORS_ORIGINS`.
* Made debug mode configurable via `MYTRAL_DEBUG` and default server bind host
  configurable via `MYTRAL_HOST` (default `127.0.0.1`).
* Upgraded password hashing to `bcrypt` and introduced backward-compatible verification
  for legacy `SHA-256` hashes; updated login to use `verify_password`.
* Hardened Strava integration: `HTTPS` OAuth authorize URL, removed token logging, and
  switched activity export to `Authorization: Bearer` instead of query-string tokens.
* Fixed several runtime issues in routes (invalid `enum`/`int` handling, uninitialized
  variables, and incorrect activity key type).
* Fixed negative index exploitation: added `index < 1` guard after `int(index)`
  conversion in exercise and symptom update/delete routes to prevent `pop(-1)` silently
  deleting the last list element.
* Fixed timing side-channel in legacy `SHA-256` password verification: replaced `==`
  with `hmac.compare_digest()`.
* Fixed CORS origins parsing: added `.strip()` to each origin to prevent
  leading/trailing whitespace causing origin mismatches.
* Added `URL` and `DSN` to env-var redaction blocklist on the admin/settings page to
  prevent credential-bearing connection strings from leaking.
* Added boot-time warning log when `MYTRAL_CORS_ORIGINS` is not set in the environment.
* Added `RuntimeError` fail-fast guard in `run.py` when `debug=True` is combined with a
  non-loopback `MYTRAL_HOST` to prevent accidental remote debugger exposure.
* Added unit tests for `hash_password` and `verify_password` covering `bcrypt`, legacy
  `SHA-256`, wrong passwords, and empty inputs.

### Fixed
- Fixed `enable_cache=False` (passthrough) mode: activities were still served from stale
  in-memory data on subsequent requests because `dataset_name()` and `set_dataset_name()`
  were not overridden in `PassthroughUserCache`, causing `_load()` to skip filesystem
  re-reads after the first request. Both methods are now overridden so every request
  always reloads activity data from the filesystem.
